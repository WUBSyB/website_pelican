Würzburg Unseminars in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology are
participant-driven meetings that give members of the bioinformatical
community a possibility to connect with each other in an informal and
casual way. WUBSyB, heavily inspired by Heidelberg Unseminars in
Bioinformatics, make use of interactive formats like BarCamps, World
Café and Hackathon/Codefest to bring them together (more details in
Budd et al., PLOS Comp Bio, 2015). Most importantly unseminars should
be fun, entertaining and informative for the participants.
